# Naviplayer_MPP
Naviplayer Multiplatform is based vaugely off of Naviplayer and it's alpha level successor that I abandoned called Naviplayer Revamped.

This is written using Kotlin Multiplatform and will support both Windows/Linux and Android.

Currently this repo is just a desktop app skeleton from IntelliJ IDEA and an alpha level Subsonic library
